          Argues<br />
          that genetically modified crops are the only way we can meet the
          demand, as<br />
          we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops are not inherently
          dangerous<br />
          because "we've been genetically modifying plants and animals for a
          long time. Long<br />
          before we called it science, people were selecting the best breeds."
